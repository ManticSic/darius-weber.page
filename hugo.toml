Eager to lead and inspire, I've actively pursued training programs in leadership and management, aiming to harness my skills for broader impact.

In mid-2023, following a reorganization, I assumed some of our team leader's responsibilities on a temporary basis.
Recognizing the potential to enhance the quality and value of our work, by the end of 2023, I advocated for assuming these tasks permanently.

Since March 2024, I have officially overseen the entire development infrastructure, among other responsibilities.

When I first joined the company, I knew there were significant transformations underway.
We were embarking on development for Linux and transitioning from SVN to Git - areas where I held considerable expertise.
I became an integral part of the centralized DevOps team tasked with spearheading these changes.

As a passionate advocate for DevSecOps principles,
I derive immense satisfaction from sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration

Alongside my primary responsibilities, I was promptly invited to contribute to a committee dedicated to enhancing the developer experience.
Today, I proudly represent this group, and together, we've spearheaded several impactful initiatives.  
Notably, we've implemented regular developer satisfaction surveys, with a technology-focused approach, to ensure continuous improvement.
Furthermore, we've established a committee tasked with enhancing software supply chain security and eliminating obstacles hindering progress.

I came here through a former colleague to set up a new team to develop an existing delivery tracking system for food retail.

Our main tasks were to modernize .Net servers and to stabilise an Android app written with Angular.
In addition to regular development I was responsible for improving the development process by increasing the automation of the build process.

Together we have managed to turn one of the worst running projects into a flagship project with just a few people in less than one year.

Shortly before the company folded, we developed a service to track, combine, and analyse truck telematics from multiple vendors.
