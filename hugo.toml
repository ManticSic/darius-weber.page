I joined the company knowing that there were some big changes going on.
They were starting to develop for Linux and they were going to move from SVN to Git - two things I had a lot of experience with.
I joined the centralised DevOps team that was responsible for both.

After a few weeks I was invited to join a committee to improve the developer experience.
Now I'm the representative of this group and together we've successfully implemented several changes.

I currently work as a DevSecOps Engineer. My main responsibilities are project management and spreading knowledge about DevSecOps.
I'm not sure at what point I switched from being a developer to someone more involved in planning and organisation. But I love it!
That's why I want to move into a management career. I've already started training in leadership and management.

I came here through a former colleague to set up a new team to develop an existing delivery tracking system for food retail.

Our main tasks were to modernise several .Net servers and to stabilise of an Android app written with Angular.
In addition to regular development I was responsible for improving the development process by increasing the automation of the build process.

Together we have managed to turn one of the worst running projects into a flagship project with just a few people in less than one year.

Shortly before the company folded, we developed a service to track, combine and analyse truck telematics from multiple vendors.

My focus was on developing applications for the POS in Java, TypeScript, .Net and Python. Later I was responsible for release and package management.
In addition to my development tasks, I took over the technical project management for a large customer.

My highlight at xplace was the introduction of Git and GitLab where I gave some internal trainings.
