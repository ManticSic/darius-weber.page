## Privacy Policy

The privacy of my visitors is very important to me. This privacy policy outlines the types of personal information is received and collected and how it is used.

### Some General Information

Like many other websites on the internet, this site is hosted on someone else's infrastructure and uses content delivery networks to provide some of the code used. In my case the following providers are involved:
- [GitHub][gh-pages-policy] to host this site on GitHub pages.
- [Strato][strato-privacy] provides the mail servers and this domain

This site does not collect data itself. Only thirt party members collect data to comply with legal obligations and to maintain the security and integrity of this site and its services.

### Log Files

In order to maintain the security and integrity of this website, the following information is recorded in log files:
- Internet protocol addresses (IP)
- Type of your used browser
- Internet service provider (ISP)
- Date and time stamp

None of this information is linked to any personally identifiable information.

### Cookies

At the moment, this site doesn't serve you any tasty cookies.

But... the [local storage][localstorage] is used to make sure you always see the right theme (dark, light).

## Disclosure Policy

This site is completely ad-free! I don't make any money from this site.  
Currently, I don't collect usage statistics, but this may change in the future.

This site contains some editorial content. I will always try to provide you with the best quality.

Despite careful control of the content, I assume no liability for the content of external links. The maintainers of the linked websites are solely responsible for their content.

Like this website, this policy is a work in progress.  
As I evolve, so will this site.
